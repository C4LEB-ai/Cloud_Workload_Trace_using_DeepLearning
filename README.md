**Dataset Preparation**: Conduct a thorough exploration and analysis of the dataset to gain insights into its structure, content, and overall quality. This step involves scrutinizing the features, detecting missing values, and removing attributes with substantial gaps in data. Ensure the dataset is well-structured and adequately reflects the diverse aspects of Cloud Workload Traces (Google and Alibaba).

**Data Preprocessing**: Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ready the dataset for model development. This includes correcting inconsistencies in the data, using SMOTE to balance the target variable, and applying MinMaxScaler to normalize features, thereby ensuring consistency and enhancing model performance.

**Model Training**: Build and train deep learning models, including ANN, CNN, and RNN, on the processed dataset. Carefully set hyperparameters for each model, such as the number of epochs, learning rates, and early stopping conditions. Monitor the training process to ensure the models learn effectively and generalize well.

**Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models by applying performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Review the outcomes to compare the modelsâ€™ effectiveness, identify areas of strength and improvement, and offer suggestions for further refinement.
